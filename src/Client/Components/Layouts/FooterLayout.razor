            Microsoft Graveyard is the virtual graveyard for all products killed by Microsoft;
            a free and open source collection of dead Microsoft applications, devices, systems, services, games, and
            more.
            This site is a passion project built because we have lovingly used many of these products before
            their untimely death.
            We aim to provide factual, historic information for products listed here.
            If something is missing, inaccurate, or you have a suggestion, visit and contribute to the
